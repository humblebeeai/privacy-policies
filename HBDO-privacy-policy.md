# HB DO — Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 2, 2026

HB DO ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy describes how we handle information when you use the HB DO iOS application.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Data You Create

When you use HB DO, you create and store:

- **Task data:** Titles, descriptions, priority levels, and completion status of your todos
- **Dates:** Creation and completion timestamps for your tasks
- **App preferences:** Display settings (e.g., sort by priority), auto-cleanup settings (enabled/disabled, cleanup period), and similar in-app choices

This information is stored **on your device only** using iOS standard storage (e.g., UserDefaults). We do not upload your task content or preferences to our servers.

### 1.2 Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect:

- Account or login credentials (the app does not require an account for core functionality)
- Name, email, or other personal identification
- Your todo text or task content on our servers

---

## 2. How We Use Information

Your todos and settings are used only to provide the app's features (task list, history, progress, auto-cleanup, statistics) on your device.

---

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

- **Your tasks and preferences** are stored locally on your device. They remain until you delete them or use in-app options such as "Clear All Todos" or "Clean Up" (completed todos).
- **Auto-cleanup:** If you enable auto-cleanup in Settings, completed todos older than the period you choose (e.g., 7–90 days) are removed from the app automatically. This deletion is permanent and only on your device.
- We do not retain copies of your task data on our servers.

---

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not sell your task data or personal information. Your todo content stays on your device unless you share your device or backup (e.g., iCloud backup) with others.

---

## 5. Security

We rely on your device's built-in security (e.g., device passcode, biometrics) and Apple's storage mechanisms. You are responsible for keeping your device secure and for who has access to it.

---

## 6. Children's Privacy

HB DO is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will work to delete it.

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will be revised when we do. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. For material changes, we may provide additional notice in the app or on our website.

## 8. Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy or HB DO's data practices, please contact us at the support or contact address provided in the app or on our website.
