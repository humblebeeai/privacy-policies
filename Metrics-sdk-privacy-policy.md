# Metrics SDK – Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2026-02-02

This Privacy Policy explains how Metrics SDK (the **“App”**) collects, uses, and protects information when you use the App. The App is provided by **HumbleBee AI** (“we”, “us”, or “our”).

By installing or using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

---

## 1. What the App Does

The App is a demo application that showcases how a device metrics SDK can be integrated into an Android application.

Its primary purpose is to:

- Collect non-personal device metrics (e.g., hardware, system, and network characteristics)
- Send these metrics to a backend API for demonstration, testing, or evaluation of the SDK

The App is **not intended for consumer use in production environments**.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

Depending on how you configure and use the App, we may collect the following categories of information:

### 2.1 Information You Provide

- **Email address (optional)**  
  - If you choose to enter an email in the demo screen, it may be included as a “user identifier” sent with metrics.  
  - If you leave the email field blank, the App will typically use an anonymous ID instead.

We do not ask for, nor do we intend to collect, names, passwords, payment details, or other highly sensitive personal data.

---

### 2.2 Device & Usage Information

Through the integrated SDK, the App may collect technical information, such as:

- **Device information:** manufacturer, model, hardware capabilities, OS name and version
- **Performance metrics:** CPU, memory, storage, battery state and health, display characteristics
- **System information:** installed codecs, certain system settings, app/package information
- **Network information:** IP-related metadata, network type (Wi-Fi / mobile), approximate region inferred from IP (no GPS)
- **Input/Output devices:** connected peripherals (e.g., input devices, sensors)
- **App telemetry:** timestamps of SDK operations, error logs, success/failure flags

This information is primarily technical and is used for analytics, fraud detection, or system intelligence purposes in the context of the SDK.

---

### 2.3 Identifiers

The SDK may generate and store:

- A pseudonymous user identifier (e.g., random UUID) stored on the device
- A project or integration identifier associated with the App or SDK configuration

These identifiers are used to associate metrics across sessions, not to directly identify a natural person.

---

## 3. How We Use the Information

We use the information collected via the App and SDK to:

- Demonstrate and test the capabilities of the metrics SDK
- Analyze device and environment characteristics
- Improve the performance, reliability, and security of the SDK and backend services
- Diagnose issues, debug errors, and monitor aggregate usage patterns
- Generate anonymized or aggregated statistics

We **do not sell your personal data**.

---

## 4. Legal Basis (for EEA/UK Users)

If you are located in the European Economic Area or the UK, we rely on the following legal bases:

- **Legitimate interests:** to test, operate, and improve our SDK and services, and to maintain security and fraud detection
- **Consent:** where required by law (e.g., if you voluntarily provide an email address and that is treated as personal data)

You can withdraw consent (where applicable) by uninstalling the App and/or contacting us (see [Contact Us](#13-contact-us) below).

---

## 5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We may share information collected through the App in the following situations:

- **Service providers:** with cloud hosting, logging, or analytics providers who process data on our behalf under contractual safeguards
- **Affiliates and group companies:** for internal business purposes, such as R&D and infrastructure
- **Legal requirements:** if required to do so by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request
- **Business transfers:** in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, subject to appropriate protections

We do **not sell or rent your personal information** to third parties for their own marketing purposes.

---

## 6. Data Retention

We retain collected information only for as long as necessary to:

- Fulfill the purposes described in this policy
- Comply with legal, accounting, or reporting obligations
- Enforce our agreements and protect our rights

Demo/test data may be retained for a limited period and then aggregated or deleted.

If you uninstall the App from your device, the local app data (including the locally stored anonymous ID and email, if any) will typically be removed from the device.

---

## 7. Data Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information we process, including:

- Encrypted transport (e.g., HTTPS/TLS) for network communication where supported
- Access control and logging on backend systems
- Principle of least privilege for employees and service accounts

However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## 8. International Data Transfers

Data may be processed and stored in countries other than your own (for example, where our cloud providers’ servers are located).

Where required, we put in place appropriate safeguards, such as:

- Standard Contractual Clauses (where applicable), or
- Other lawful transfer mechanisms under relevant data protection laws

---

## 9. Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under the age of 16 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction).

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

If you believe that a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

---

## 10. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:

- Access the personal data we hold about you
- Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data
- Request deletion of your data (“right to be forgotten”)
- Object to or restrict certain processing
- Request data portability (where technically feasible)
- Withdraw consent, where processing is based on consent

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at **privacy@yourcompany.com** and include sufficient information to identify you and your request. We may need to verify your identity before responding.

---

## 11. Third-Party Links and Content

The demo App is primarily self-contained.

If, in future versions, it links to third-party websites or services, those will be governed by their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services.

---

## 12. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will:

- Update the **“Last updated”** date at the top of this page, and
- (Optionally) provide an in-app notice or other reasonable notification, where required by law

Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
